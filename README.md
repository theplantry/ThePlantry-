🌱 The Plantry | Artisanal Staples, Rooted in Jamaica
Welcome to the official repository for The Plantry. This project is a minimalist, high-end e-commerce experience showcasing small-batch spices, infusions, and handcrafted baked goods born from the heart of Jamaica.

🎯 Brand Vision
The Plantry is more than a store; it’s a curated pantry of high-vibrational staples. Our aesthetic balances the raw, earthy textures of artisan bread with a sleek, monochromatic "apothecary" visual style.

Signature System: Our products are categorized by a curated numbering system (e.g., Island Chai .003, Umamix .002).

The Ethos: Small-batch, organic, and biodynamic sourcing with a focus on Jamaican flavors and minimalist ingredients.

🛠 Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS (CDN)

Typography: * Serif: Playfair Display (Luxury, heritage, elegance)

Sans: Inter (Clean, modern, readable)

Interactions: Intersection Observer API for scroll animations and smooth-scroll transitions.
